summary: I found this window somewhere in England
artistnote1: I can't remember where but it is a beautiful period window, probably medieval. 
artistnote2: I love the way medieval bricks turn a pinksh colour with age. This makes for a fascinating pattern, in its way rather beautiful.
artistnote3: This picture was intended as a study for a larger picture which was never painted. The window again opens a channel into the mysteries of this old building and its past. Who looked out of this window? What did they think? What did they hope for?
