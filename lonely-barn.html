work: Lonely barn in Derbyshire, England.
media: Oil on canvas
size: 12 x 14 inches
summary: This old barn stands near the village of Eyam, Derbyshire.
artistnote1: This village has acquired an infamy as one of many places where the Black Death (aka bubonic plague to modern medicine) decimated the population.
artistnote2: As so often with these old buildings I wonder what happened in and around them. How many simple folk worked within them? Was the barn the focus of their lives?
artistnote3: Note the attractive Derbyshire stone used to build the barn. The gives the local buildings a beauty to which people flock in their leisure time.
