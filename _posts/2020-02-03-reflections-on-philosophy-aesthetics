text1: We must first discuss the definition of art, a problem which has taxed philosophers for over two thousand years. I’ll go with the definition which says that art is that which:

is created to evoke aesthetic pleasure
has no other purpose

This definition distinguishes art from things which are aesthetically pleasing but which have a purpose, such as furniture or well-presented food. Or the British crown jewels, which are also aesthetically pleasing, but which were designed for the purpose of coronating and distinguishing the British monarch.
