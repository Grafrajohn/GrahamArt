## The beutiful city of Girona, in the Catalonia region of Spain

Girona is not a city on the popular tourist map of Spain but it is delightful for lovers of history and cilture.

## Roman mosaic in Girona

Archaeologists think that this Roman mosaic might be related to chariot races. It was once part of a large mosaic which showed a complete panorama of a chariot race - the drivers, the audience, the Roman VIPS and the chariot stadium itself. The Romans settled Girona and many remnants of their civilisation still survive in the city.

## Medieval Christian art
