introduction: For a while now I have been surveying the wisdom of the philosophy
  of aesthetics to say if I can figure out exactly what is the accepted
  definition of heart by five and that there is no accepted definition of art
  and that some philosophers such as Wittgenstein even suggest that that’s works
  perfectly well without a definition.

For a while now I have been surveying the wisdom of the philosophy of aesthetic’s to say if I can figure out exactly what is the accepted definition of heart by five and that there is no accepted definition of art and that some philosophers such as Wittgenstein even suggest that that’s works perfectly well without a definition.

It can Stein says that we all know at when we see it

However this seems to me to be an unsatisfactory way to approach a definition of art.  However I do appreciate that the object shins least in recent times the definition of that happy if any valid objections us.  So is there a way to actually do fine art?

I suggest that there might be a way to define that by looking at the processor created it.

What if we looked at the language of signs and dipped into the discipline of senility to see this could be helpful in defining that.

In addition lay what if we say that that is the communication process between Hans.  But basically through at one that can communicate with another.
