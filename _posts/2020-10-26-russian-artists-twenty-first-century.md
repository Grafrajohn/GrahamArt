## Russian art in the twenty first century has come a long way since socialist realism

Many people when thinking of Russian art tend to think of Constructivism in the years following the 1917 Revolution, or of Socialist Realism from the 1930s to the 1950s.

However after the deth of Stalin Russian art began to open up and as long as artists did not criticise the Soviet system they were able to make art which was figurative and interesting. The Soviet education and training system for artists appears to have been the equal of any in the world, and has left Russia with a commnity of well trained artists.
