## Russian art in the twenty first century has come a long way since socialist realism

Many people when thinking of Russian art tend to think of Constructivism in the years following the 1917 Revolution, or of Socialist Realism from the 1930s to the 1950s.

However after the death of Stalin, Russian art began to open up and as long as artists did not criticise the Soviet system they were able to make art which was figurative and interesting. The Soviet education and training system for artists appears to have been the equal of any in the world, and has left Russia with a community of well-trained artists.

Russians have never lost touch with their history. They have a lot of history to look back on, and do not have to avoid the appalling legacies which European imperialist countries have such as colonial exploitation, slavery or genocide. This in my opinion makes Russian art interesting, as the Russians freely mix references to their history and culture into their art in a way that is rarely seen in Europe or the USA.

So, who are the Russian artists whose work reflects the proud splendour of their past? Here are a few of my picks.

## Pavel Pokidyshev

This St Petersburgh artist makes incredible work, instantly recognisable. His works seem to be a sort of painterly mashup of Russian history and nature.

## Olga Suvorova

This St Petersburgh artist paints incredible colourful paintings drawn from the rich imperial history of her home city.
