introduction: Creativity thrives on the interaction between the artist and
  society. So with interaction minimised in the lockdown how do we cope?
---
Interaction with society feeds all of us with ideas and beaks the vicious circle of isolation. But now we are told we cannot interact and we must self isolate.\
\
This is not good for anyone but especially not for creatives.

So what do we do? Well here is my strategy.

* Read arty books. You may well have a collection of them built up over the years. I inherited my fatherâ€™s 1980s and 1990s coffee table books. The 80s and 90s were the golden age of the coffee table art book before the Internet and multimedia killed them off. There is nothing better than leafing through a book of Gaugin/Hopper (amend as necessary).
