introduction: Creativity thrives on the interaction between the artist and
  society. So with interaction minimised in the lockdown how do we cope?
---
Interaction with society feeds all of us with ideas and beaks the vicious circle of isolation. But now we are told we cannot interact and we must self isolate.\
\
This is not good for anyone but especially not for creatives.

So what do we do? Well here is my strategy.

Read arty books. You may well have a collection of them built up over the years. I inherited my fatherâ€™s 1980s and 1990s coffee table books. The 80s and 90s were the golden age of the coffee table art book before the Internet and multimedia killed them off. There is nothing better than leafing through a book of Gaugin/Hopper (amend as necessary).

Go to Zoom meetings. All of the arts organisations are having them. Some are free and some require a ticket. But there is enough conversation going on in cyberspace.

Don't think too much. Confined to our homes we can adopt the habit of filling the interaction gap by reflecting on ourselves. But this can be a bad habit and is a cause of the infamous cabin fever.

Go out for a walk every day or night. Walking, even past the closed cafes and shops, at least brings some variety into your sensory input.

Meditate and practice mindfulness. Mindfulness and meditation is very good for you and allows you to clear your mnd. If you really can clear your mind completely then I envy you. But even clearing some of the clutter is a step forward.

If money is stressing you then try ecommerce! There is some money to be made on the Internet if you know where your customers are and what they want. Whatever you are selling it can be sold online. Performances can be sold on ticketing sites such as EventBrite. Paintings can be sold on Facebook. Music can be sold via iTunes and Google Play. YouTube and Patreon carry subscripton content from which you can earn income. Online art markets allow the upload of paintings and photography. Just about anything can be sold on eBay; one guy even put his soul on there. I know from first hand experience that selling online is very difficult. But it can be done.

Finally avoid the use of alcohol or other dampeners to try and control cabin fever. This can get you into bad habits for the future. 

If you are lucky enough to have good friends and family then call them a lot - conversation is very therapeutic.
