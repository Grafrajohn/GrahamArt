A few people have emailed me and asked how I cope with the COVID pandemic, since I am often out and about blogging on the subject of culture.

## COVID Isolation

Well, let us say that interaction with society feeds all of us with ideas and breaks the vicious circle of isolation. But now we are told we cannot interact and we must all to varying degrees socially distance or even self-isolate.

This is not good for anyone but especially not for creatives or naturally gregarious people. I confess I am not gregarious but I am, as you can see from this website, creative.

## How to cope with COVID isolation

So what do we do? Well here is my strategy for creatives.

Read arty books. You may well have a collection of them built up over the years. I inherited my fatherâ€™s 1980s and 1990s coffee table books. The 80s and 90s were the golden age of the coffee table art book before the Internet, tablets and multimedia killed them off. For me there is nothing more uplifting than leafing through a big full colour book on Gaugin, Rousseau, Van Gogh or Hopper (amend as necessary for your on taste).

Go to those arts Zoom or meetings or Facebook events which land in your email tray. All of the major arts organisations are organising them. Some are free and some require a paid ticket. But there is arts enough conversation going on in cyberspace. Try www.eventbrite.co.uk as a good place to start. Your local arts society may also have organised talks on the activities of prominent members. 

If you live alone, as more and more people do, and find yourself isolated, don't think too much i.e. don't overthink. Confined to our homes we can adopt the habit of filling the interaction gap by reflecting on ourselves. But this can be a bad habit and is one cause of the infamous cabin fever. I once had a troubled friend who took to reading books about self analysis and ended up analysing himself into neurosis.

Go out for a walk every day or night. Walking, even past the closed cafes and shops, at least brings some variety into your sensory input.

If you are lucky enough to have a canine companion i.e. a dog, make the most on interactions with this intelligent and responsive creature. Anthropologists think that humans and dogs may have co-evolved in mutual partnership, and there may be an emotional aspect to this co-evolution. So dogs may be genuinely helpful during the COVID enforced isolation.

Meditate and practice mindfulness. Mindfulness and meditation is very good for you and allows you to clear your mind. If you really can clear your mind completely then I envy you. But even clearing some of the clutter is a step forward. There are plenty of mindfulness and meditation videos on the Internet, which will show you how to relax and achieve some inner peace, if you really try hard. I know that some people struggle to separate themselves from the trials of daily life, though I have always been fortunate in that I can isolate myself from the daily routine, and I do not dwell on things that I cannot control. So COVID may provide you with an opportunity to learn how to distance yourself from the daily grind in a way which benefits your soul. Remember that your soul is precious and is easily damaged, and there are evil souls out there who wilfully damage the souls of others.

If, as an artist, money is stressing you, then try ecommerce! There is some money to be made on the Internet if you know where your customers are and what they want. Whatever creative product you are selling it can be sold online. Performances can be sold on ticketing sites such as EventBrite. Paintings can be sold on Facebook. Music can be sold via iTunes and Google Play. YouTube and Patreon carry subscription content from which you can earn income. Online art markets allow the upload of paintings and photography. Just about anything can be sold on eBay; one guy even put his soul on there. I know from first hand experience that selling online is very difficult. But it can be done.

Think about using this quiet time to build your customer base. Read up about CRM - you know that there is free CRM out there which will help you to build your customer relationships with buyers, retailers, venues, galleries, arts influencers and so forth. Try www.hubspot.com. 

Finally avoid the use of alcohol or other dampeners to try and control cabin fever. This can get you into bad habits for the future. 

If you are lucky enough to have good friends and family then call them a lot - conversation is very therapeutic.

Remember everyone else is in the same boat. Good luck.
