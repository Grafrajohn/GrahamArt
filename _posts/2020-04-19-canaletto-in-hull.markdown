When I visited the Ferens Gallery in Hull years ago I expected, and I was not disappointed, to see some great paintings. 

I was shocked however to see a Canletto masterpiece - a painting of Venice no less. I would have expected to travel hundreds of miles to see one.

In 2005 a Canaletto picture of Venice sold for a cool Â£18.6 million.
