## Definition of Art

Since Plato wrote on what we now call the philosophy of aesthetics, many philosophers have discussed the nature of art and beauty. They have ascertained art and beauty to be two different but related things. What is beautiful is not always art, for example a rose. What is art is not always beautiful, for example Picasso‘s “Guernica”.

We must first discuss the definition of art, a problem which has taxed philosophers for over two thousand years. I’ll go with the definition which says that art is that which:

  * is created to evoke aesthetic   pleasure
  * has no other purpose

This definition distinguishes art from things which are aesthetically pleasing but which have a purpose, such as furniture or well-presented food. Or the British crown jewels, which are also aesthetically pleasing, but which were designed for the purpose of coronating and distinguishing the British monarch.

However we soon run into trouble with the above definition of art. It excludes some forms of art such as dance music, which was created to give aesthetic pleasure but has the purpose of facilitating dancing. Also some religious art from the great churches of Europe was commissioned to educate the illiterate about the ways of God and Christ but it may not have been conceived to evoke aesthetic pleasure.

So let’s try again with our definition of art. If we just say that something was created primarily to give aesthetic pleasure, and may have no other purpose, is that enough? Maybe it is. Primarily is the key word here. Emanuel Kant, no slouch in philosophy, suggested that we abandon efforts to  reach a definition of art since artworks have so little in common that they defy a logical definition.

## Definition of Beauty

Socrates and Plato thought that there was a deep underlying set of ideas and concepts which defined the world and which were appreciated by the mind. Plato thought that beauty did not come from these deeper concepts but was instead derived from the senses.

Later during the Renaissance Alberti suggested that beauty was harmony and perfection.

Later still during the Enlightenment Cooper suggested that beauty and truth were the same and this was innate to people. Hutcheson added that to appreciate beauty both the inner intellect and the senses work together.

Surely it is true that appreciation of beauty involves the senses and the use of innate concepts  maybe planted in all of us by nature herself. Mysterious and unknowable.

## Is art good or bad?

Plato famously thought that art was bad because artists represented things that they did not understand, and represented bad things too. They might thus corrupt audiences by introducing them to the thoughts and deeds of bad characters.

In his “Poetics” Aristotle argued that art is cathartic and in this capacity enables us to safely consider unpalatable things.

Kant thought that through the artist, nature expressed herself. Since human beings are themselves a product of nature, this makes sense to me. This a profound idea and still potentially of great use in our modern world.

It seems to me that when art does represent bad things, it either represents bad things which have already happened or forewarns us of bad things which could happen. Steven Spielberg’s “Schindlers’s List” did the former and George Orwell’s “1984” did the latter. Therefore this representation of the bad is not necessarily harmful. Even bad characters such as Shakespeare’s Falstaff remind and forewarn us of the criminal’s capacity for evil.

In the twentieth century Dickey suggested that our notions of beauty are in fact socially derived more than from philosophical principle. Marxists and Freudians have also moved the appreciation of art away from the purely philosophical. Freud looked for repressed forces in the works of the great masters, and suggested that for example Leonardo was afraid of women. Marx suggested that Greek art was valued because of its origins in a simpler and in many ways better time before capitalism, and also because bourgeois collectors wish to inflate the value of rare Greek sculptures.

The Nazis condemned and destroyed ‘degenerate’ art. But their definition of degenerate included  virtually everyone who disagreed with them and some groups of people who would not be considered degenerate in the civil societies of the twenty-first century such as Jews, Gypsies, socialists and homosexuals. This raises the question of who decides what might be ‘good’ and ‘bad’ in art? Maybe it is best to let art be art, and make our own judgements.

## The subject in painting

Recently I have been trying to grapple with the concept of the subject in painting, as it has been debated by modern philosophers. More of this when I have made some progress…
