introduction: For a while now I have been surveying the wisdom of the philosophy
  of aesthetics to see if I can understand exactly what is the accepted
  definition of art.  I find that there is no universally accepted definition of
  art, even after 2400 years of philosophical debate. Indeed some philosophers
  such as Wittgenstein theorised that art works perfectly well without a
  definition.

Wittgenstein famously said the following about art:

* it is impossible to define art
* we all know art when we see it
* art works quite well without a definition

However this seems to be an unsatisfactory way to approach a definition of art. If we all now art when we see it, then it should be easy to define.Â So is there a way to actually define fine art? 

## The problem with art and definitions

The problem is that art has a variety of different forms especially nowadays.

## Have we been looking at definitions of art the wrong way?

I suggest that there might be a way to define art by looking at the process of creating it. I thought about this and it seems that trying to define art through its end result may indeed be impossible, especially nowadays where even artists cannot agree on what art actually is.

What if we looked at the language of signs and dipped into the discipline of semiology to see this could be helpful in defining that.

In addition what if we say that art is the communication process between hearts - basically how one heart can communicate with another.

So how about defining art as a means of communication, and everything that is the result of this mode of communication is art. Let's explain this further.
