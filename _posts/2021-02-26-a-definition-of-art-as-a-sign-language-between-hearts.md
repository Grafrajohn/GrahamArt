introduction: Wittgenstein famously thought that it was impossible to define
  art, but we all know it when we see it, and besides he said, art works quite
  well without a definition Surely if we all know art when we see it, it must be
  possible to define it? Here is my humble attempt at a definition.

Wittgenstein famously said the following about art:

* it is impossible to define art
* we all know art when we see it
* art works quite well without a definition

In its way this view is quite fun but I and a lot of other people find it troubling. After all if we all now art when we see it then surely it must be possible to define it.

I thought about this and it seems to me that trying to define art through its end result may indeed be impossible, especially nowadays where even artists cannot agree on what art actually is.

So how about defining art as a means of communication, and everything that is the result of this mode of communication is art. Let me explain further.
