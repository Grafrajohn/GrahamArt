introduction: For a while now I have been surveying the wisdom of the philosophy
  of aesthetics to see if I can understand exactly what is the accepted
  definition of art.  I find that there is no universally accepted definition of
  art, even after 2400 years of philosophical debate. Indeed some philosophers
  such as Wittgenstein theorised that art works perfectly well without a
  definition.

It can Stein says that we all know at when we see it

However this seems to me to be an unsatisfactory way to approach a definition of art.  However I do appreciate that the object shins least in recent times the definition of that happy if any valid objections us.  So is there a way to actually do fine art?

I suggest that there might be a way to define that by looking at the processor created it.

What if we looked at the language of signs and dipped into the discipline of senility to see this could be helpful in defining that.

In addition lay what if we say that that is the communication process between Hans.  But basically through at one that can communicate with another.

Wittgenstein famously said the following about art:

* it is impossible to define art
* we all know art when we see it
* art works quite well without a definition

In its way this view is quite fun but I and a lot of other people find it troubling. After all if we all now art when we see it then surely it must be possible to define it.

I thought about this and it seems to me that trying to define art through its end result may indeed be impossible, especially nowadays where even artists cannot agree on what art actually is.

So how about defining art as a means of communication, and everything that is the result of this mode of communication is art. Let me explain further.
