## Happy Birthday Beverley

The market town of Beverley is 1300 years old today. Founded by St John, the town grew from its spiritual origins into a major cultural and economic community.

At the heart of the town was always its minister. A religious, educational and musical centre, it still dominates the skyscape of the town.

In the Minster is a statue of St John.
