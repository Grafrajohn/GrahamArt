<p>I came across this car during a classic car rally in Beverley in the summer. I was struck by its beauty - the motor car as art!</p>
<p>I researched this photograph and I think the car is a 1957 Mercury Turnpike Cruiser. Please correct me if I am wrong.</p>

<p>The damp climate in the United Kingdom would make this a difficult car to maintain due to all the chrome.</p>
