description: The Hanseatic League is a modern day revival of the old medieval
  trading league which existed to promote trade and international friendship
  between nations. Geographically the league encompasses the Baltic nations and
  those of North West Europe and the Eastern British Isles. Hanseatic ships
  carried goods of all kinds between a variety of ports including Lubeck in
  Germany and Beverley in North Eastern England. This painting reflects the
  modern Hanseatic League and is for an upcoming exhibition in Riga, in summer
  2021, called 'Hansetic Gold'. This exhibition may or may not go ahead due to
  the COVID pandemic.

introduction: >-
  This painting is my attempt to capture the spirit of the modern Hanseatic
  League for an upcoming exhibition - 'Hanseatic Gold' - which alas may not now
  happen due to the COVID-19 pandemic.


  Nevertheless I will complete the painting so at least some people can enjoy it.

The painting is inspired by an early medieval painting sheen below.

My painting attempts to bring in the many modern scientific and technological developments which have occurred since the medieval picture was painted! These include robotics, civil engineering, business, agriculture, telecommunications, flight, and containerization of shipping to name but a few.
