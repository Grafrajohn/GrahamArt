For some artists such as Van Gogh and Lowry isolation would have come naturally. They were isolated in the lives they led.

On the other hand many artists such as Raphael were social men and women who would have struggled with self isolation as much as anyone else.

So how do we cope with self-isolation? Well actually better than many people because, as long as we still have art materials to hand, we can create. This applies to musicians too - a period of performance inactivity can actually allow creatve reflection on artistic direction.
