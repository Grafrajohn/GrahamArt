<h2>The Derbyshire tradition of well dressing</h2>
<p>In Derbyshire the pagan tradition of well dressing survives and has been co-opted by Christianity. Over the years I have seen some beautiful well dressings.</p>
<p>This particular well dressing was in the Church of St Mary and All Saints, Chesterfield.</p>
