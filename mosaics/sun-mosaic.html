work: Sun Mosaic

summary: I made this mosaic for our dining room table.
artistnote1: Disney liked it and asked if they could use it in their family arts magazine.
  I said yes, of course.
artistnote2: The mosaic is made from special tiles but not the terrarium tiles favoured
  in ancient Rome.
artistnote3: Mosaics are the only works of art which look today like they did centuries
  ago. I think they are one of the most undervalued forms of art. I guess I just like
  mosaics.
