        <h2>Graham's artistic statement</h2>
        <p>I believe that art of all kinds is food for the soul.</p>
        <p>My aim is to make art which follows the ABC of art:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accessible</li>
          <li>Beautiful</li>
          <li>Contentful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As I and my work develop and change I will continue to paint and see where the journey takes me.</p>
