        <p>I was born in Scotland. I have lived in Lincolnshire, Derbyshire and Yorkshire where I currently live.</p>
        <p>I was educated at the University of Leeds, England and Heriot Watt University, Edinburgh, Scotland.</p> 
        <p>When not painting I create commercial digital content. I have travelled to Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland, Holland, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Malta, Norway, Scotland, Wales, Ireland, Czech Republic, Sweden, Finland, Poland, Russia, Turkey, Morocco, Tunisia, Australia, Singapore, India, Mexico, Colombia, Peru, United States of America and Canada.</p>
        <p>My artistic influences include Gauguin, Vermeer, Van Dyck, Van Gogh, Rousseau, Hopper, Basquiat and many more.</p> 
        <h2>The works</h2>
        <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dtn9ari2r/image/upload/a_exif/v1572737515/misc/2008_Summer_009.jpg" alt="Winsor and Newton Oil Paints">
        <p>The oil paintings featured in these web pages were painted with Windsor and Newton Artists, Talens Rembrandt or Sennelier Extra-Fine Artists’ quality oil paints on stretched primed canvases, with some acrylic underpainting. Watercolours are painted in Winsor and Newton Artists watercolours, gouache and artists’ ink on heavy acid-free watercolour paper.</p>
        <p>From time to time my work has featured in exhibitions, art galleries and Disney magazine and features in a few private collections.</p>
        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>Everyone needs inspiration and here are the <a href="artist-links.html">artists and works</a> which inspired me.</p>
        <h2>My artistic statement</h2>
        <p>I believe that art of all kinds is food for the soul.</p>
        <p>My aim is to make art which follows the ABC of art:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accessible</li>
          <li>Beautiful</li>
          <li>Contentful</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As I and my work develop and change I will continue to paint and see where the journey takes me.</p>
