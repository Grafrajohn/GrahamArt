summary: This is a study for an oil painting of a hay barn in the Peak District Derbyshire
artistnote1: I exhibited it in the Ferens Gallery in Hull. There is a Canaletto in
  there so it was nice for one of my pictures to rub shoulders with greatness....
artistnote2: I use watercolours mostly for studies, they are at once an easy medium
  to start with and a very difficult one to master.
