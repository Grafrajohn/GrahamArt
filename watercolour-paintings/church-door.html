work: Church Door
media: Watercolour on paper
size: 25 x 18 inches approx
summary: This is the old door of a church in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, I think.
artistnote1: I like the character of England's histopric buildings and they have considerable
  charm and beauty often found in the smaller details. This door was made of wonderfully
  seaasoned wood which had taken on an attractive reddish colour ofver the years.
artistnote2: I am not sure, but this might be a door from the Church of St Mary and
  All Saints, Chesterfield. This church has long been famous in Britain for its twisted
  spire, but it is also a functioning church with a thriving congregation.
artistnote3: The stained glass windows in the church are interesting and there is
  a written guide to each one for visitors, which explains the many details in each
  window.
