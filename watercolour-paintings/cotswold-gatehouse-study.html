work: Cotswold Gatehouse Study
media: Watercolour on paper
size: nn x nn inches
summary: This was a study for an oil painting that never got painted.
artistnote1: Maybe one day it will. The gatehouse is to Stanway House, a particularly
  beautiful English Jacobean hous which is well worth a visit.
artistnote2: Note the peculiar reddish colour of the Cotswold stone which gives this
  part of britain its particular character and charm.
