worktext1: This Tudor half-timbered manor house was once the residence of the Earl of Macclesfield, who warded over the then extensive broadleaf forests much favoured by Royalty for hunting. Mary Fitton also lived here, the maid of honour at the court of Elizabeth I and allegedly the 'dark lady' of Shakespeare's sonnets. Now the home of Mr and Mrs Timothy Richards.
