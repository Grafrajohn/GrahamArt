# Corona Virus pandemic and the visual arts

I thought I would blog about the impact of corona virus on the arts in East Yorkshire, and it is the same story that we hear across the United Kingdom as a whole.

Of course our first thoughts are with those who might be vulnerable to the virus and the families and loved ones of those for whom it has already had serious or tragic consequences.

Having said that the virus is going to wipe out a whole year for many artists and indeed people in mushy walks of life.
