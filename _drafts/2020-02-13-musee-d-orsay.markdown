description: Visit to the Musee d'Orsay in Paris
introduction: >-
  Since Plato wrote on what we now call the philosophy of aesthetics, many
  philosophers have discussed the nature of art and beauty. They have
  ascertained art and beauty to be two different but related things. What is
  beautiful is not always art, for example a rose. What is art is not always
  beautiful, for example Picasso‘s “Guernica”.

  We must first discuss the definition of art, a problem which has taxed
  philosophers for over two thousand years. I’ll go with the definition which
  says that art is that which:<br><ul><li>is created to evoke aesthetic
  pleasure</li><li>has no other purpose</li></ul>This definition distinguishes
  art from things which are aesthetically pleasing but which have a purpose,
  such as furniture or well-presented food. Or the British crown jewels, which
  are also aesthetically pleasing, but which were designed for the purpose of
  coronating and distinguishing the British monarch.<br><br>However we soon run
  into trouble with the above definition of art. It excludes some forms of art
  such as dance music, which was created to give aesthetic pleasure but has the
  purpose of facilitating dancing. Also some religious art from the great
  churches of Europe was commissioned to educate the illiterate about the ways
  of God and Christ but it may not have been conceived to evoke aesthetic
  pleasure.<br><br>So let’s try again with our definition of art. If we just say
  that something was created primarily to give aesthetic pleasure, and may have
  no other purpose, is that enough? Maybe it is. Primarily is the key word here.
  Emanuel Kant, no slouch in philosophy, suggested that we abandon efforts to
  reach a definition of art since artworks have so little in common that they
  defy a logical definition.<br>

  Socrates and Plato thought that there was a deep underlying set of ideas and
  concepts which defined the world and which were appreciated by the mind. Plato
  thought that beauty did not come from these deeper concepts but was instead
  derived from the senses.<br><br>Later during the Renaissance Alberti suggested
  that beauty was harmony and perfection.<br><br>Later still during the
  Enlightenment Cooper suggested that beauty and truth were the same and this
  was innate to people. Hutcheson added that to appreciate beauty both the inner
  intellect and the senses work together.<br><br>Surely it is true that
  appreciation of beauty involves the senses and the use of innate concepts
  maybe planted in all of us by nature herself. Mysterious and unknowable.

  Plato famously thought that art was bad because artists represented things
  that they did not understand, and represented bad things too. They might thus
  corrupt audiences by introducing them to the thoughts and deeds of bad
  characters.<br><br>In his “Poetics” Aristotle argued that art is cathartic and
  in this capacity enables us to safely consider unpalatable things.<br><br>It
  seems to me that when art does represent bad things, it either represents bad
  things which have already happened or forewarns us of bad things which could
  happen. Steven Spielberg’s “Schindlers’s List” did the former and George
  Orwell’s “1984” did the latter. Therefore this representation of the bad is
  not necessarily harmful. Even bad characters such as Shakespeare’s Falstaff
  remind and forewarn us of the criminal’s capacity for evil.<br><br>In the
  twentieth century Dickey suggested that our notions of beauty are in fact
  socially derived more than from philosophical principle. Marxists and
  Freudians have also moved the appreciation of art away from the purely
  philosophical. Freud looked for repressed forces in the works of the great
  masters, and suggested that for example Leonardo was afraid of women. Marx
  suggested that Greek art was valued because of its origins in a simpler and in
  many ways better time before capitalism, and also because bourgeois collectors
  wish to inflate the value of rare Greek sculptures.<br><br>The Nazis condemned
  and destroyed ‘degenerate’ art. But their definition of degenerate included
  virtually everyone who disagreed with them and some groups of people who would
  not be considered degenerate in the civil societies of the twenty-first
  century such as Jews, Gypsies, socialists and homosexuals. This raises the
  question of who decides what might be ‘good’ and ‘bad’ in art? Maybe it is
  best to let art be art, and make our own judgements.

alt-image4: The tricky subject of the subject in painting
text4: >-
  Recently I have been trying to grapple with the concept of the subject in
  painting, as it has been debated by modern philosophers. More of this when I
  have made some progress…

I was recently fortunate enough to visit the fine city of Paris including the Musee d'Orsay, which is an art museum located in a former railway station. This works out much better than you might expect.

The railway station used was a large old station from the nineteenth century, designed to accomodate the great steam engines of that era. Consequently is has high arch-shaped roofs which let in plenty of light and also the sheer size of the place somehow enhances many of the great sculptures and paintings displayed there.

![The Musee d'Orsay has a grandeur of its own which enhances the art](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtn9ari2r/image/upload/v1583263287/blog/1720DB2D-E443-4523-95B4-B4BCEC62F627.jpg)

The museum is organised into different eras, as is the way with large colllections of works, and these span everything from classical art through to modern art. On the ground floor there is a central isle of sculpture. There are plenty of places to sit down and contemplate which is very important in a collection of this scope and quality.

Here a lot of works are on show from Carpeaux, Preaulx, Guillaume and others. Overall it has a very French feel. On either side of the aisle of sculptures are impressive collections of paintings by Manet, Courbet   Bazille, Cezanne, Degas, Bonnad, Vuillard and others. The Courbets were particularly fascinating to me as I have seen very little of his work before.

On higher floors there were many works of impressionism, post impressionism and early twentieth century modern movements, though nothing one could really call avante garde.

The symbolist pictures of Moreau and others made a big impression on me as I have not really studied works by this group of artists, or indeed taken a great interest in them. I do now.

Another pleasant surprise was the Art Nouveau exhibiton, where delightful furniture and paintings were on display together.

In fact there was a lot of furniture at the Musee d'Orsay, so if you see art in a broader context you will particularly enjoy this museum. It is really also a museum of design.

I was fascinated by how Art Nouveau influenced the popular art, culture and fashion of the 1960s.

Whatever your tastes the Musee d'Oray should delight your senses.
