As far as we know Leon Battista Alberti wrote the first theoretical book on painting. It seems he had the intention of raising painting to the same lofty status as music and poetry. At the time he wrote his famous book or treatise, 1435, painting was ranked alongside manual crafts such as carpentry.

Alberti thought that the painter needed to create a good painting as follows:

* Create a convincing three-dimensional space in the picture
* Model light and shadow to create bodies that look three-dimensional
* Place figures in various poses to create a compelling narrative
