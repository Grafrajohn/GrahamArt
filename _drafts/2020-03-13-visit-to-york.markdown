description: Reflections on the philosophy of aesthetics
introduction: >-
  Since Plato wrote on what we now call the philosophy of aesthetics, many
  philosophers have discussed the nature of art and beauty. They have
  ascertained art and beauty to be two different but related things. What is
  beautiful is not always art, for example a rose. What is art is not always
  beautiful, for example Picasso‘s “Guernica”.

A visit to the city of York in England is always a pleasure. It is a beautiful city and rightfully one of the most visited destinations in the United Kingdom.

For architecture York is almost incomparable; Medieval, Georgian, Victorian buildings provide a feast for those who appreciate the long architectural history of Western Europe. Many of the buildings are still in active use as cafes, shops and local government offices. The city walls provide a fascinating walk. In particular foreign visitors can see from these medieval walls a panorama of modern British life as within their domain is a thriving business and residential community.

Of particular interest to me is the medieval York Minster, which has in its stained glass windows one of the great British and international masterpieces - the Great East Window. This is the largest medieval stained glass window in the world.
