description: Reflections on the philosophy of aesthetics
introduction: >-
  Since Plato wrote on what we now call the philosophy of aesthetics, many
  philosophers have discussed the nature of art and beauty. They have
  ascertained art and beauty to be two different but related things. What is
  beautiful is not always art, for example a rose. What is art is not always
  beautiful, for example Picasso‘s “Guernica”.
