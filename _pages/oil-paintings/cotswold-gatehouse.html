summary: I found this Jacobean gatehouse while exploring the Cotswolds region of England and was taken by its beauty. 
artistnote1: The building is of Jacobean architecture, built of traditional red Cotswold stone. Described as one of the architectural gems of England the hall itself is the centre of a working estate which has changed hands once in 1275 years, and is the residence of Lord Neidpath.
artistnote2: The hall also has a particularly good fountain to look at.
artistnote3: With pictures like this one the building itself becomes a way of playing with colour, line and form. I see the picture as almost abstract and conceptual but given structure by the form of the building.
