Art was born when one of our hunter-gatherer ancestors marked the walls of a cave with a stone, or carved a piece of wood with a flint, or drew a picture in the sand with a stick. They created a likeness of something. And maybe another member of the tribe said 'That's nice'. Thus started the age of Prehistoric Art.
## Prehistoric Art
Prehistoric artists developed a primitive pallete made from earth colours such as, well, earth for brown, maybe burned wood cinders for black, animal blood for red, powdered chalk for white and so forth.

Maybe they painted with their fingers, or used primitive brushes made from leaves or animal hairs.

They painted primtive pictures on cave walls, some of which have survived down the ages. Some of their pictures are no more or less primitive than pictures which hang in art galleries and museums. Art has come full circle? We'd better stop with that.

Romans copied

## Byzantine 313-1420 AD

Giotto of Florence. First modern artist who was celebrated. Painted realistically. Became a famous celebrity.

Brunelleschi. Florence cathedral.

Donatello. Great sculptor.

Durer spread the Renaissance in Northern Europe, travelled to Italy

Bosch - arguably greatest Dutch painter

## Reformation

Reformation hampered painting as religious paintings were seen as Papal idolatry.

Holbein - painted honest portraits instead of religious pictures

Brugel - honest portraits

Baroque
Architectural mashup of previous styles

Caravaggio - realistic lighting, not beautiful people

Carracci

Poisson - based on classical ideas

Rubens - soulful portraits. Unprecedentedly famous during his time.

Van Dyck - sickly, painted Charles I court

Velazquez

Protestant Holland - pious merchants created market for genre and portrait paintings. Few aristocratic or religious commissions for painters.

Baroque caused Italian art to decline as artists painted pictures for effect and not content.

## Realism 1850 - 1870

## Age of Reason
English ideas dominate

Christopher Wren - Baroque influenced his St Paul’s Cathedral but end result was plainer than Catholic Baroque.

Hogarth - painted pictures of lessons. English aristocrats would not buy from English artists.

Reynolds - painted character well in portraits

Gainsborough - portraits

Chardonnay - ordinary folk painted

French Revolution disparaged Baroque and reverted to Greek

Idea that one could choose the architecture of a building. It might be Gothic style or Greek style, and the ‘Gothic revival’ and ‘Greek revival’ were born which led to the Regency Period in England.

Washington DC is Greek revival.

In eighteenth century academies took over from apprenticeship system to teach art and old ways declined. Emergence of salons.

Goya - portraits and etchings which questioned things

Blake - seen as a loon

Delacroix - colour and imagination more important than draughtsmanship and knowledge

Millet - realistic painting of ordinary people
