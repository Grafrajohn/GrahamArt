Art was born when one of our hunter-gatherer ancestors marked the walls of a cave with a stone, or carved a piece of wood with a flint, or drew a picture in the sand with a stick. They created a likeness of something. And maybe another member of the tribe said 'That's nice'. Thus started the age of Prehistoric Art.
## Prehistoric Art
Prehistoric artists developed a primitive pallete made from earth colours such as, well, earth for brown, maybe burned wood cinders for black, animal blood for red, powdered chalk for white and so forth.

Maybe they painted with their fingers, or used primitive brushes made from leaves or animal hairs.

They painted primtive pictures on cave walls, some of which have survived down the ages. Some of their pictures are no more or less primitive than pictures which hang in art galleries and museums. Art has come full circle? We'd better stop with that.
