work: The artist's hands
media: Oil on canvas
size: 20 x 16 inches
summary: The hand of the artist is what creates all art. Or at least before Jackson Pollock and his drip paintings.
artistnote1: Painting hands is one of the most difficult things to do and catches out lessr painters. So here I simply paint my own hands.
artistnote2: Also of course our hands are what mark us out as human beings. They say whales are maybe as intelligent as we, but without hands they cannot do much to express their intelligence. We humans have shaped our destiny with our hands and will continure to do so. So in fine art the hands occupy a special place and significance. 
artistnote3: Hands can also express things themselves. Here I am not sure what my hands express but it is maybe something to do with openness. This gesture just seemed a good one to paint.
