work: Window at Oxborough Hall, Norfolk.
media: Oil on canvas
size: 38 x 28 inches
summary: I spotted this window whilst visiting Oxborough Hall and its form caught my attention.
artistnote1: Orange and blue are opposites so the orange bricks of the ornate chimneys seemed to contrast very well against the blue Norfolk summer sky. Sometimes beauty can be a simple thing.
artistnote2: As always I was attracted by the geometric shapes of the instricate chimney stonework, and the generally attracive architectural features. 
artistnote3: In case you are wondering why such ornate chimneys were built on these houses, the reason was to keep sparks away from the roof, which at the time would have been made of thatch, or straw.
