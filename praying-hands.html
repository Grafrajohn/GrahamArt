summary: My own version of a praying hands print.
artistnote1: Though lino print is a limited medium the results can be striking. There is certain discipline in working to its limitations.
artistnote2: Here I have produced a simple graphic image on an enduring theme - faith and spritiuality. The praying hands may represent a faith in an omnipresent being from an organised religion or a simple gesture to the supremacy of fate in all of our lives. 
artistnote3: My own belief is that spirituality runs deeper than organised religion, and that spritiuality or religion may advise us on life but they never have the right to force us to do anything.
