summary: Every artist paints the occasional self-portrait and this is a great way to learn how to paint portraits.
artistnote1: When I painted this I was less worldly than I am now. I was still an idealistic socialist, before I lapsed into liberalism. My favourite painter was Van Gogh. I don't listen to the Sex Pistols much now. I still like football. I still play guitar.   
artistnote2: I have more regular haircuts than when I looked in the mirror to make this picture.
artistnote3: The fish is a prehistoric fish, palaeontology being something that has always fascinated me. The whale represents my continuing belief that we have a duty to preseve the natural world.
