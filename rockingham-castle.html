alt-image: Barn at Rockingham Castle
work: Stone outhouse at Rockingham Castle, Northamptonshire, England.
media: Oil on canvas
size: 30 x 40 inches
summary: I liked the colours of the Cotswold stone from which this barn was made
artistnote1: These houses are the last vestiges of who we once were. The remnants of fedualism. For this reason they are fascinating.
artistnote2: I always get a great feeling of connection from these places which were home not just to the high and mighty but also the many people who made the feudal system work; the peasant farmers, soldiers, officials, groundkeepers, cooks, scribes who would have lived in a Kingly place such as this. 
artistnote3: The castle was built by William the Conquerer in the 11th century and used by Kings of England until the 16th century until it was granted to the Watson family who still live there. The Castle acquired literary fame when used by Charles Dickens as the model for Chesney Wold in Bleak House.
