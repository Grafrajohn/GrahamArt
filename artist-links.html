            <p>These artists and works inspired me and I hope they inspire you also. A list like this could go on forever, so I have limited it to those atists who MOST inpired me!</p>
            <h2>Mosaics</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image1 }}" alt="{{ page.alt1 }}">
            <p>Mosaics are one of the most ancient art forms, quite literally, as they adorned Roman and Greek palaces. Some of the mosaics are great works of art, such as the one above, which is from the 4th century BC and depicts a stag hunt. Additionally what fascinates me is that mosaics made out of stone do not fade and weather like paintings and so look the same now as they did thousands of years ago.</p>
            <h2>Medieval Art</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image2 }}" alt="{{ page.alt2 }}">
            <p>I love the simplicity and directness of medieval art. OK so they had not figured out perspective, nor the full nuance of painting which came from the later renaissance masters, but they made up for it with almost modern composition and directness, and they were not afraid of bold colours. The work of this period, in Europe, was often Christian in nature and the above work shows Mary Magdalen announcing the Resurrection to the Apostles, St Albans Psalter, English, 1120–1145.</p>
            <h2>Jan van Eyck</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image3 }}" alt="{{ page.alt3 }}">
            <p>The Flemish master Jan van Eyck (approximately 1380 to 1441) is a huge figure in the development of painting. He pioneered techniques in oil painting.</p>
            <h2>Johannes Vermeer</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image4 }}" alt="{{ page.alt4 }}">
            <p>Johannes Vermeer (1632 to 1675) further pioneered oil painting techniques, composition and subject matter.</p>
            <h2>Vincent Van Gogh</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image5 }}" alt="{{ page.alt5 }}">
            <p>Vincent Van Gogh was the seminal tragic painter of the 19th century. He had a dynamic painting style and a great sense of colour. I love the way his brush strokes form an important part of his paintings.</p>
            <h2>Paul Gauguin</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image6 }}" alt="{{ page.alt6 }}">
            <p>Paul Gauguin searched for a better world for mmuch of his life, and then tried to portray it beatifuly in art. He arguanbly failed in the former but definitely succeeded in the latter.</p>
            <h2>Vassily Kandinsky</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image7 }}" alt="{{ page.alt7 }}">
            <p>Vassily Kandinsky (1866 to 1944), is an intellectual father figure for modern abstract art. He taught art in Moscow after the October Revolution, but soon found his ideas out of line with the Communists. So he moved to Germany, and taught art theory at the legendary Bauhuas art school in Weimar. Alas the Nazis did not like his ideas either and some of his works were confiscated and exhibited in the imfamous Nazi 'Dgenerate Art' exhibition before being burned. Again he moved, this time to Paris, where he settled for the rest of is life.</p>
            <h2>Marc Chagall</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image8 }}" alt="{{ page.alt8 }}">
            <p>Marc Chagall painted beautiful and spiritual paintings drawn from his interest in Russian and Jewish mysticism.</p>
            <h2>Salvador Dali</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image8-1 }}" alt="{{ page.alt8-1 }}">
            <p>Salvador Dali was the best known Surrealist painter and hugely technically gifted as an artist.</p>
            <h2>Hopper</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image9 }}" alt="{{ page.alt9 }}">
            <p>Edward Hopper lived quietly in America and painted many evocative pictures of an era ignored by many of his contemporaries.</p>
            <h2>Andy Warhol</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image10 }}" alt="{{ page.alt10 }}">
            <p>Andy Warhol injected major impetus into American Pop Art and made the commercial screen printing process acceptable as fine art. In some ways he himself was almost a work of art.</p>
            <h2>Roy Lichtenstein</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image11 }}" alt="{{ page.alt11 }}">
            <p>A pop artist like Warhol, Roy Lichtenstein also used commercial printing techniques to make paitnings that were inspired by comics.</p>
            <h2>Basquiat</h2>
            <img class="align-self-start mr-3 img-fluid" src="{{ page.image12 }}" alt="{{ page.alt12 }}">
            <p>Jean Michel Basquiat was a major New York painter of the 1980s. His tragic and early death put a stop to a great talent.</p>
