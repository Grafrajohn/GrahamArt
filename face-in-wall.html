summary: This 16th century mansion was built around the ruins of a medieval priory. The priory hosted visits from Edward I, Edward II and Edward III. More recently the mansion hosted visits from Dr Livingstone, Washington Irving, Nathaniel Hawthorne, Edward VII and George V. It is however best known as the temporary residence of Lord Byron during the early years of his dazzling literary fame. His former apartments are open to the public.
