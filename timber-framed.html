work: Timber Framed Study
media: Watercolour on paper
size: 8 x 6 inches approx
summary: Another study for an oil painting that never got painted
artistnote1: I can't remember where the house was, somewhere near Warwick, Emgland.
artistnote2: As usual with a timber framed house I like the geometrical arrangement of the timbers and the starkly contrasting patterns they made.
artistnote3: Watercolours are great for studies and can be carried around easily in a tin.
