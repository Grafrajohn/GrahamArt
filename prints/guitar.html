summary: Screen printing seemed a natural medium for this iconic electric guitar, the Gibson Les Paul Standard.
artistnote1: Music has always been central in my life. 
artistnote2: When I was in my late teens few people knew more about the popular music scene than I did. I listened to contemporary music, jazz, classical but most of all the popular greats such as the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Doors, Who, Yes, Pink Floyd, Hendrix, Velvet Underground and so forth.
artistnote3: This is only an early attempt at screen printing and I have to say I didn't find it to be as much fun as painting or relief printing. I might try again at some point.
