alt-image: Original lino print of Albert Einstein
work: Albert Einstein
media: Linoleum print
size: 10 x 8 inches
summary: Lino relief print is a great medium for portraits as the artist can simplify and take out what is not necessary. 
artistnote1: With this portrait of Einstein I used the medium to focus on the weathered and warm featuresof Einstein's face, which reveal his famously deep intellect and humanity.
artistnote2: Einstein was a man who had fled from persecution in the Europe of Hitler and Mussolini and was known for expressing his disappointment in the ethical development of humanity at that particuler time in history. There is something of that weariness in his eyes and I have endevoured to capture it.
artistnote3: This is more than anything a face of wisdom and great intelligence.
