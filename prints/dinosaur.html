work: Dinosaur
media: Linoleum print
size: 10 x 8 inches
summary: The medium of lino print here gave me an opportunity to explore the stark contrasts of the fossilised skull of Tyrannosaurus Rex.
artistnote1: Dinosaurs fascinate nearly all of us and have done since our childhoods. Maybe it is the magic appeal of animals so unfamiliar and in the case of T.Rex terrifying.
artistnote2: This fossil was a particularly good subject for a monotone relief print and allowed me to capture the stark functionality of the predatory form of T.Rex. Also the monotone nature of the print hints that while we can grasp at what T.Rex would have looked like, and how he might have lived, we can never be sure. This gives the dinosaurs a captivating mystique.
