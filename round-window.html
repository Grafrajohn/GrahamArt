summary: This round window is at Newstead Abbey in Nottinghamshire. I like windows and the unusual nature of this one made it a good subject.
artistnote1: Lord Byron stayed at Newstead Abbey and I wonder if this window inspired him as he dreamed. 
artistnote2: The circular form of the window and its inset floral shape suggests an alluring 'come and look'. 
artistnote3: The weathering of the stone around the window makes for a pleasing mix of colours which complements the shape and simple beauty of the window's design.
