work: Still life with assorted fruits.
media: Oil on canvas
size: 12 x 14 inches
summary: This picture started out as my own take on the Cezanne still life. Let's
  hear it for organic produce.
artistnote1: I tried in the picture to make sure a good range of colours were represented
  across the spectrum.
artistnote2: The fruits represent nature of course and our cultivation of it. Maybe
  the table cloth beneath represents the way we try to layer nature on top of our
  own world, to invite nature into our sphere. Remembering of course that we are ultimately
  derived from nature ourselves.
artistnote3: I have tried to replicate the simple beauty of nature here with these
  fruits. No need for anything other than just the colours before me.
