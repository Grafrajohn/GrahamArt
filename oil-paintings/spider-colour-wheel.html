summary: The colour wheel is important in art as it explains how colours are related
  - which colours to mix to get a given tone and how to create a new colour from other
  colours. For example yellow and blue makes green. Yellow and red makes orange.
artistnote1: The spider's web is a fascinating non-geometric pattern in nature. It
  is also made of an elastic silk-like substance.
artistnote2: Fitting a colour wheel into a spider's web made a certain amount of sense,
  since the circular spiral design of the web easily incorporates the different hues
  of colour.
artistnote3: The spider in the centre of the picture is the common and harmless English
  garden spider. These creatures fatten themselves in autumn to either lay their eggs
  and die, or survive quietly until the following spring. Spiders are of course one
  of mankind's greatest friends, as they protect us from the insects which would otherwise
  feast on our crops.
