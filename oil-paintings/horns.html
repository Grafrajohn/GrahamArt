summary: These horns are from a cow which once lived in Mexico.
artistnote1: I have tried to immortalise the cow through art, which is the least we can do considering the fate of the poor creature.
artistnote2: It is funny how the simplest thing from nature is more interesting than anything man made.
artistnote3: Still I wonder about the cow. Did its life have meaning? Does my life have meaning? Does your life have meaning? It's a big question and through the simple motif of this cow's horns we think about it. If there is a God may he bless the creature and all others.
