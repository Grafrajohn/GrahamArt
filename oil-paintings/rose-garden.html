summary: The rose garden is a place conjured up in my imagination
artistnote1: This painting was inspired by other paintings and also a yearning to
  create a spiritual picture which evokes the pastoral sentiment of which we British
  are so fond.
artistnote2: There are a number of interpretations of the picture which are too numerous
  to elucidate so I am happy for people to interpret the work in any way they choose.
artistnote3: What links this work together is time as represented in the clock. Time
  is as a string binding us all together; everything we are now is the consequence
  of all things in all past times.
