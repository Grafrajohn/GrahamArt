work: Gawsworth Hall, Cheshire, England.
media: Oil on canvas
size: 30 x 42 inches
summary: I love the geometric shapes and patterns and the stark contrasting colors
  of the timbers in these magnificent old English timber framed houses.
artistnote1: I found the patterns in the wood here to be quite mesmerising. Not just
  the herring bone pattern of the timbers but the decorative features of the petal
  like features in the wood. And the black and white just looks great as a pattern.
  Again this is a structured abstract picture.
artistnote2: In general this picture is about the beauty of art - here obviously the
  house is the art. Or rather architecture is applied art. Also this picture speaks
  of how we like to beautify the things which are important to us, such as our homes.
  And why not? Beauty never harmed anyone. Ugliness is simply guilty of envy.
artistnote3: This Tudor half-timbered manor house was once the residence of the Earl
  of Macclesfield, who warded over the then extensive broadleaf forests much favoured
  by Royalty for hunting. Mary Fitton also lived here, the maid of honour at the court
  of Elizabeth I and allegedly the 'dark lady' of Shakespeare's sonnets. Now the home
  of Mr and Mrs Timothy Richards.
