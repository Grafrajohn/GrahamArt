summary: I was fascinated by the Derbyshire stone from which this barn was built,
  which gave it a particularly pretty patterned appearance.
artistnote1: Derbyshire stone is very colourful don't you think? A range of warm colours
  can be found in the stones in this picture, which give the work the appearance of
  an abstract pattern, with structure from the form of the building.
artistnote2: Sometimes I think that I am really an abstract painter interested in
  colour and line, and that I pick subjects because they have colour and line. Also
  there is an element of repetition in the work, which signifies the patterns and
  repetition of our lives.
artistnote3: The window here is dark and blue, which to me hints at a inner world
  invisible to the viewer but nonetheless tantalising. The cobwebs in the window suggest
  an errie emptiness. Who knows?
