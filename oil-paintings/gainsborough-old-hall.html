summary: I loved the majesty of this magnificent window feature on a very old English manor house in the quiet English town of Gainsborough.
artistnote1: One of the best preserved late medieval manor houses in England, built circa 1460 by Sir Thomas Burgh. This view features the stone bay window, built some time after 1460 at great expense.
artistnote2: Richard III visited the hall in 1483 and the Mayflower pilgrims worshipped here in 1607. The Hall is now owned by Gainsborough's local government and is preserved as a museum.
