summary: Venice is the most beautiful place on earth. I loved my visits to this city.
artistnote1: This is one of many beautiful windows in a city where beauty lies around
  every corner, where very fine taste is designed into everything. The Rennaisance
  artists and architects had perfect taste.
artistnote2: There are also many fine churches, frescoes and of course the many views
  painted by Canaletto. I like venice because its lack of roads and traffic has given
  it the chance to live as a city without being strangled by a million cars.
artistnote3: This window of course was in a residential house, where the owners had
  placed house plants on the window sill, and drawn their blinds. They also had a
  mooring post for their boat, as one does in Venice. Simply a fabulous city. Sadly
  as can be seen from the painting, the city is somewhat decaying, and the residents
  and government are in a constant battle with time to preserve its magnificence.
