summary: I found this old stone barn somehwere in Derbyshire years ago and liked the
  colors of the mosses on its stones, and how it seemed to have grown out of the land.
artistnote1: I have always been fascinated by the old stone buildings we have in England,
  which are hewn out of the land and seem to be a part of it.
artistnote2: This barn in particular was covered in a gree-blue moss which gave it
  a particularly beautiful tone. It also had a solidity and had probably stood there
  for several centuries, serving as a hay store for the famer's amnimals during the
  long cold English winters.
artistnote3: No doubt this barn is and has always been home to many creatures and
  serves as a small ecosystem for rodents, insects and a myriad of other species.
  In this sense the barn becomes a living and changing entity.
