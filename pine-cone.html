work: Pine Cone
media: Drypoint print

summary: I recently tried my hand at print making using aluminium plates
artistnote1: This was my first attempt at a drypoint print with a somewhat rough aluminium plate, but I could see the potential of this medium with good plates.
artistnote2: Pine cones of course represent the cycle of life of which we are all part.
artistnote3: Additionally a pine cone is a fascinating object to draw and paint because of its natural fractal patterns and geometry.
